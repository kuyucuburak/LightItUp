# Light It Up

Light It Up is a puzzle game that is developed with Flutter by using [Flame](https://docs.flame-engine.org/1.0.0/) game engine for [Flutter Puzzle Hack](https://flutterhack.devpost.com/).

We hope that this also will be a helpful resource for whom want to develop a game with flame game engine, especially for new starters!
